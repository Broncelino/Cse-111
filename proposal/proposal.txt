Significant Program Proposal

(This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best knowledge
at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the beginning to the
end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and some of the ideas we
proposed change. This is part of completing any project and is fine.
However, we still must write a proposal so that our teachers or
supervisors know what we intend to do. Please answer each of the
following questions to the best of your knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?    :Pokemon battle simulator

2. What real world problem will your program address or help to solve?        :Boredom

3. What will you learn from developing this program?      :libral use of dictionaries/classes not sure which if not both and a lot of calculations

4. What Python modules will your program use? (Some examples are: csv,
datetime, functools, matplotlib, math, pandas, pytest, random, requests,
and tkinter.)

:Random, and maybe something to do visuals but probably not

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?        :yes

6. Will you write test functions to test many of your program functions?      :no
